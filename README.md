Description:
Built a fully responsive Spotify clone as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate front-end development skills using React. The project replicates Spotify's user interface and core features by integrating the Spotify Web API for fetching music data.

Responsibilities & Features:

Integrated Spotify OAuth authentication for secure login

Fetched real-time songs, albums, playlists, and user profile data using Spotify API

Implemented music player controls (play, pause, next, previous) with persistent player state

Used Redux for managing user state and API data flow

Ensured full mobile responsiveness and a smooth user experience

Outcome:
This project showcases my ability to build interactive, real-world applications using React and API integration, aligning with my interest in full-stack and front-end development.
